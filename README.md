#### 🚀 OmniLend: Cross-Chain Lending Platform

### 🎯 Project Overview

OmniLend is a next-generation decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for seamless, multi-chain asset lending and borrowing. The platform leverages AI-driven risk models and audited smart contracts to offer users safe, transparent, and optimized lending experiences.

Current DeFi lending is fragmented across separate blockchains, limiting capital efficiency and user experience. Users must manually bridge assets between chains, creating friction and additional costs.

### Our Solution
OmniLend enables seamless cross-chain lending through:
- **Unified Liquidity Pools** - Aggregate funds across multiple blockchains
- **Instant Cross-Chain Execution** - Deposit on Chain A, borrow on Chain B
- **Automated Risk Management** - Real-time health factor monitoring and liquidation
- **ZetaChain Integration** - Built for omnichain future

## 🎮 How to Use
